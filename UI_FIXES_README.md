# RDN Fee Scraper UI Fixes

## Summary of Changes

The following improvements have been made to the RDN Fee Scraper UI to enhance user experience and fix display issues:

### 1. Process Log Visibility

- **Issue Fixed**: Process Log was previously hidden until scraping completed
- **Solution**: Separated Process Log container from results container and made it immediately visible when scraping starts
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/public/dashboard.html` - Restructured HTML to separate Process Log section
  - `/public/js/dashboard.js` - Updated to ensure Process Log visibility on scrape start

### 2. Database Fee Card Display

- **Issue Fixed**: Database fee card wasn't consistently showing despite data being available
- **Solution**: Made database fee card always present in HTML with proper styling and enhanced JavaScript detection logic
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/public/dashboard.html` - Added always-present database fee card 
  - `/public/js/dashboard.js` - Improved database fee detection from multiple sources
  - `/public/css/dashboard.css` - Added specific styling for database fee card

### 3. UI Flow Correction

- **Issue Fixed**: UI elements were appearing in incorrect order
- **Solution**: Restructured HTML to follow correct flow: Process Log → Case Information → Category Tables
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/public/dashboard.html` - Reorganized structure to ensure correct visual flow

### 4. Source Name Standardization

- **Issue Fixed**: Inconsistent source naming ("Case Page" vs "Updates")
- **Solution**: Normalized all source names to use "Updates" instead of "Case Page"
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/public/js/dashboard.js` - Added source normalization in fee processing logic

## Testing

To test these UI fixes with the latest server version, use the included scripts:

- Windows: Run `test_fixed_ui.bat`
- Linux/Mac: Run `./test_fixed_ui.sh`

These scripts will launch the application using the most recent server-upgradedv2.py file.

## Expected Behavior

1. When starting a scrape, the Process Log should immediately appear with the initial log entry
2. The Case Information and Category Tables should remain hidden until scraping completes
3. The Database Fee card should be visible in the Case Information section if data is available
4. The UI should follow a logical flow with Process Log first, followed by Case Information and Category Tables
5. All sources in tables should show as either "My Summary" or "Updates" (not "Case Page")

## Adherence to CLAUDE.md Specifications

All changes adhere to the specifications in CLAUDE.md, ensuring:
- Database fees are displayed in a card, not in tables
- Category-specific tables use the appropriate styling
- The Process Log is visible throughout the scraping process
- Sources are normalized according to requirements
